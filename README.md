# IEEE-HKN Robot Arm
IEEE-HKN at Texas A&M built a robotic arm that is able to pick up and drop stuff, move on its own, and even has 2 thumbs!

The code in the repository is implemented mainly relying on the StandardFirmata module for Arduino. Using pygame and other integrations, we were able to connect an X-box controller to the arduino to control various motors in the robotic arm.

There is a NEMA motor, some heavy duty servos, and some light servos.
